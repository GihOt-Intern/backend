# ThetaStarPathfinding Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds pathfinding capabilities to troops using the ThetaStarPathfinder algorithm. Instead of direct movement towards a target, troops will now follow a calculated path that avoids obstacles.

## Changes Made

1. Created a new `TroopPathfindingService` class to handle:
   - Path calculation using ThetaStarPathfinder
   - Path storage and management
   - Waypoint handling for troop movement

2. Modified `TroopInstance2` class to:
   - Use the pathfinding service for movement
   - Clear paths when new targets are set
   - Follow calculated paths point by point
   - Fall back to direct movement when no valid path is found

3. Added unit tests for the new functionality

## How It Works

1. When a troop is given a target position via `setMoveTarget()`:
   - Existing paths are cleared
   - The target position is stored

2. When the troop moves via `moveTowards()`:
   - If no path exists, a new path is calculated using ThetaStarPathfinder
   - The troop moves towards the first waypoint in the path
   - When a waypoint is reached, the troop moves to the next one
   - If the path is completed or becomes invalid, a new path is calculated

3. The ThetaStarPathfinder algorithm:
   - Takes a grid representation of the map
   - Finds the optimal path considering line-of-sight
   - Returns a path as a list of grid cells
   - These grid cells are converted back to world positions

## Benefits

- Troops now navigate around obstacles instead of trying to move through them
- More realistic movement patterns
- Ability to handle complex terrain
- Fallback to direct movement when no path exists

## Testing

The implementation includes unit tests to verify:
- Path calculation and following
- Waypoint reached detection
- Path clearing when targets change
- Fallback to direct movement when no valid path exists
